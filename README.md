## Steps
1 - First I initialized the nest project, init git, we have an empty project now.

2 - Second, define a function calculatePrice

3 - Make sure it's working by testing the null return

```
  pnpm t
```

4 - Now we should describe types (book, list books)

5 - START WRITING TESTS

> Simple tests : differents books

> Simple tests : identical books

> [!NOTE]  
> Of course, all tests are failing until now.

6 - Write the solution

> [!NOTE]  
> We could remove switch and define discount as array

> [!WARNING]  
> Something goes wrong, a test fail: 
    Expected: 184.4
    Received: 184.39999999999998
